description: This is the [New York Times TimesTags API v1.0.0](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/timestags-product/1/overview) OpenAPI specification. With the TimesTags API, you can mine the riches of the New York Times tag set. The TimesTags service matches your query to the controlled vocabularies that fuel NYTimes.com metadata. You supply a string of characters, and the service returns a ranked list of suggested terms. The TimesTags service can help you build a tag set, standardize names of people and organizations, or identify subjects that are currently making news. Information architects and librarians may also wish to compare Times tags to Library of Congress subject headings and other classification systems.
