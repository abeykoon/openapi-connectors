## Overview

This is the [New York Times Archive API v1.0.0](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/archive-product/1/overview) OpenAPI specification.  With the New York Times Archive API you can get all NYTimes article metadata for a given month. The Archive API returns an array of NYT articles for a given month, going back to 1851. Its response fields are the same as the Article Search API.  The Archive API is very useful if you want to build your own database of NYT article metadata. You simply pass the API the year and month and it returns all articles for that month. The response size can be large (~20mb).
