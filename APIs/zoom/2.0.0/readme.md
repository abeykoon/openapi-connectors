## Overview

This is the [Zoom API Version 2.0.0](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/zoom-api) OpenAPI Specification. The Zoom API allows developers to access information from Zoom. You can use this API to build private services or public applications on the [Zoom App Marketplace](http://marketplace.zoom.us). To learn how to get your credentials and create private/public applications, read our [Authorization Guide](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/guides/authorization/credentials).  All endpoints are available via `https` and are located at `api.zoom.us/v2/`. For instance you can list all users on an account via `https://api.zoom.us/v2/users/`.
## Prerequisites
