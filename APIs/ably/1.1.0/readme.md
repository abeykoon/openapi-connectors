## Overview

This is the [Ably REST API v1.1.0](https://ably.com/documentation/rest-api) OpenAPI specification. The [Ably REST API](https://www.ably.io/documentation/rest-api) provides a way for a wide range of server and client devices to communicate with the Ably service over REST. The REST API does not provide a realtime long-lived connection to Ably, but in all other respects is a simple subset of the full [realtime messaging API](https://ably.com/documentation/realtime).
## Prerequisites

  Create an [Ably account](https://ably.com/) and obtain tokens following [this guide](https://ably.com/documentation/core-features/versions/v1.1/authentication).
